Step 1: DATA CLEANING
Data cleaning is a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning. Here are some common steps in Python for cleaning data, typically using libraries like Pandas and NumPy:

1. Import Libraries: Begin by importing necessary libraries. Pandas is commonly used for data manipulation, and NumPy for numerical operations.
2. Load Data: Load dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Inspect Data: Get an overview of the dataset to identify potential issues.
4. Handle Missing Values: Missing data can be handled in several ways, such as removing rows/columns with missing values or imputing them with mean, median, or another relevant value.
5. Correct Data Types: Ensure that each column is of the correct data type.
6. Remove Duplicates: Duplicate rows can skew for analysis.
7. Filter Outliers: Outliers can affect the results of for analysis. Identified and removed them if necessary.
8. Normalize/Standardize Data: For numerical data, normalization or standardization can be crucial, especially in machine learning.
9. Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into a form that could be provided to ML algorithms.
10. Feature Engineering: Created new features from the existing data that might be relevant for analysis.
11. Saving Cleaned Data: Finally, save the cleaned data for further analysis.

Datasets that used for analysis and preprocessing  are listed below:
A. Companies
B. Benefits
